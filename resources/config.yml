# HereAuth configuration file

# Default settings for each account (players can change them if they have the permission)
DefaultSettings:
  # Enable these methods for automatic authentication
  AutoAuth:
    # Automatically authenticate if the client secret is same as the last login
    # "Client secret" is a password automatically sent by the client, and is different for every
    #   server (so other servers can't steal it) and changes with device.
    ClientSecretAuth: true
    # Automatically authenticate if the player joins from the IP address same as the last login
    # IP (Internet Protocol) address identifies the network that the player connects from. People
    #   from the same network (e.g. having the same Wi-Fi) have the same IP address. Also, two
    #   players with dynamic IP may have overlapping IP address record (but it is a rare case).
    IPAuth: false
    # Automatically authenticate if the player has the same UUID as the last login
    # UUID is the combination of IP address and client ID (and username too).
    # Client ID is a value that can be easily stolen, so using it alone is not reliable.
    UUIDAuth: false
  # Mask some data about the player before authenticating
  Masking:
    # If the player cannot be automatically authenticated, teleport him to another location (e.g. spawn).
    # He will be teleported back when he is authenticated. This may cause extra chunk loading time,
    #   but players can choose to enable/disable this and/or set their own values
    # This will not work if player joins the server too fast, before the database returned the data for the player
    Location:
      Enabled: false
      # Where is the default "another location"?
      # Format for spawn in world "some_level": "?spawn?@some_level"
      # Format for spawn in the player's world: "?spawn?@?current?"
      # Format for specific coordinates (x, y, z) in world "some_level": "x,y,z@some_level"
      # Format for specific coordinates (x, y, z) in the player's world: "x,y,z@?current?"
      Value: "?spawn?@?current?"
    # Do not send the inventory to the player unless he is auto-authenticated.
    Inventory: true
  # Multi-factor authentication
  # Apart from checking the password (or through AutoAuth), also check these:
  MultiAuth:
    # Player must use the same skin as the last login
    Skin: false
    # Players may be unable to login without realizing that they have dynamic IP if you enable this.
    IP: false
  # If the player has not been online for this number of days, turn off multi-factor auth for him.
  # Put -1 for "forever".
  MultiAuthTimeout: 14

# Disallow these if the player is registered but not authenticated
# "Chat" and "Command" are unavailable options, because HereAuth will consider all chat messages as register information
# "true" = disallow, "false" = allow

# Do not let multiple players of the same name be online together!
# This plugin uses an intelligent system that uses client secret and IP to identify the client.
# If client secret is the same (optionally check IP address too), kick the old player (possibly he crashed and rejoins).
# Otherwise, don't let the new player join (possibly trying to kick the new player using the poor implementation of
#   this mechanism in PocketMine core).
MultiSesCtrl:

  Enabled: true
  # Check BOTH IP address and client secret.
  # Theoretically, client secret should never be stolen unless the database of this server is leaked.
  # But we are adding this, just to be safe.
  # This may disallow the player to join if he changed his Wi-Fi and his IP changed, so we aren't check this by default.

# The place to store data
Database:
  # The type of database to use.
  # Currently, only "JSON" and "MySQL" are available.
  # JSON: one JSON per account, plus one metadata JSON file, plus one lightweight SQLite database for storing
  #   registering rate against IP addresses
  Type: JSON
  # Please check this if you are using JSON.

# Options related to audit logger
AuditLogger:
  # Where to log in?
  # This is only the folder, relative to the plugin's data folder.

  # What to log?
  # These should be file names relative to LogFolder mentioned above, or start with a / for absolute paths

# Options related to registering
Registration:

  # If ForceRegister is set to false, players who didn't register will not be counted as a registration.
  RateLimit:
    Accounts: 3
    Days: 30
  # Minimum password length, in UTF-8 bytes. (i.e. if you put 6 here, you have to at least type two Chinese characters,
  #   since one Chinese character takes 3 bytes in UTF-8)

  # Maximum password length, in UTF-8 bytes.
  # Put -1 for infinity (non-modded MCPE will limit it, though)

  # Enable this to disallow the password to be purely letters (26 alphabets of two cases)

  DisallowSlashes: true
  # Require the player to repeat their password after typing for the first time.
  RequireConfirm: true
  # Extra information to require (mandatory) when registering
  # These data will be stored into the database (into the `opts` column), but HereAuth will not automatically do
  # anything about it.
  # If you want these data to be handled, e.g. if you want an email to be sent to that address, please request/make
  #   another plugin that will handle them. The developer documentation has a tutorial for that.
  # The "RegExp" line is optional. If the player input does **not** match your regular expression (if any), it will be
  #   rejected, just like how password is rejected if it is too short.
  # The RegExp used here is interpreted using PCRE (Perl-Compatible Regular Expression). Please be careful to comply
  #   with YAML formats (especially with backslashes).
  # The "ErrorMessage" line is required if the "RegExp" line is present. It will be sent if the regular experssion is
  #   violated.

# Make players' appearance change if they have not been authenticated
Appearance:
  # Make unauthenticated/logged-out players invisible
  # This uses the "potion effect invisibility" style of invisibility, where modded players may be able to see the player
